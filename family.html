<p style="line-height:2.0; font-size: 20px; ">My Dad’s name is Syed Mohar Barakbah bin Syed Faozi. He is currently 56 years old. My dad thought me a lot about being responsible which led me to become a more experienced individual. My mother’s name is Sharifah Fauziah binti Syed Mohsin. She is currently 57 years old. She is a very caring and loving person. My sister’s name is Sharifah Farah Nurhani binti Syed Mohar. She is currently 27 years old. She is also a caring sister and we always try to help each other sometimes. Although I had some issues with my family sometimes, I still love them all.</p>
